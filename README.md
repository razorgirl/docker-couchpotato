# docker-couchpotato

Dockerfile to set up a Couchpotato container (based on CentOS 7)

## Build

    docker build --tag apps/couchpotato .

## Run

    docker run -d -p 5050:5050 -v <LOCAL_MOVIES_FOLDER>:/movies --name couchpotato apps/couchpotato

## Known Problems

As CouchPotato routinely updates itself, the Docker container will stop to run after an update. This is because CouchPotato restarts itself in the process and a Docker container stops once the initially running process ends. When that happends, you need to restart the container with

    docker start couchpotato

Starting with Docker 1.3, you can now use the `--restart=always` flag to let Docker handle the automatic restart of the container.

    docker run -d -p 5050:5050 -v <LOCAL_MOVIES_FOLDER>:/movies --restart=always --name couchpotato apps/couchpotato

Thanks to Ashex1 for the hint!
